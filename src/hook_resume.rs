//! The herdr resume-command report leg of `clauth
//! hook-profile-changed-note`: tell the herdr pane a conversation runs in how
//! to bring that conversation back, so a herdr restart restores it as
//! `clauth resume <session> --profile <account>` instead of herdr's builtin
//! bare `claude --resume <id>` — which loses the account and answers `No
//! conversation found` for isolated-store sessions.
//!
//! The hook is the only component that natively knows both halves of that
//! command: the CC session id arrives in the hook payload, and the resolved
//! account is the same tier-walk answer the account note and the exact-owner
//! stamp carry. As a Claude Code child inside the pane it also inherits
//! `HERDR_PANE_ID`/`HERDR_BIN_PATH`, which the herdr plugin's own watcher
//! cannot see (it joins on pids and only ever learns clauth's minted ids).
//!
//! Fires on `SessionStart` and on a real attribution change — the two events
//! that can change the resume command (the session id or the profile moved) —
//! never on every tool call. Outside a herdr pane (no `HERDR_PANE_ID`, or no
//! herdr binary), without an attributable account, and on any failure of the
//! bounded report spawn, the leg is silence: herdr's builtin plan stays as the
//! fallback, which is exactly the restore behavior a box had before this leg
//! existed.
//!
//! The report carries `--state working`: every fire happens while Claude Code
//! is working, so the value is true at fire time. herdr rejects a foreign
//! state on a pane its own integration has anchored (its detection keeps the
//! chip) and shows the state only on panes it cannot judge itself, where the
//! value clears when the agent process exits.
//!
//! The seq is minted epoch-ms and persisted on the conversation's note
//! record, because herdr drops a report whose seq is not strictly newer than
//! the stored one — a fresh process whose first mint landed on the same
//! millisecond as the previous process's last report would otherwise be
//! silently lost.
